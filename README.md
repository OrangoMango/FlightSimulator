# FlightSimulator
I'm working on it :)  
A flight simulator made in Java with my 3D engine.

## Current features
* Plane speed
* Rotate airplane on the X and Z (Y) axis
* Procedural generation of the terrain

## How to run
* Build the jar of the 3D engine from https://github.com/OrangoMango/Rendering3D with the command `./gradlew :engine3d:jar`
* Create a directory `libs` and put it there (Copy it from engine3d/build/libs/)
* Run the application with the command `./gradlew :run`
